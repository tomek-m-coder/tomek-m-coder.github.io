Portfolio Website
My name is Tomek, I am (nearly) 12 years old and I am learning how to code websites.
This is my portfolio, which I created during winter holiday 2020 with my mum.
It starts with very poor projects, because I didn't know much back then, and shows the story of my learning.
I have finished all Responsive Web Design challenges from FreeCodeCamp in this time (still have problems with media queries thought)
I hope you will enjoy!
